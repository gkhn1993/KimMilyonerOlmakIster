It is a simple information competition game that I developed in c# using windows forms app. There are totally 15 questions in this game. The user earns a quantity of  money for every right answer. If the user answers all questions correctly he would earn the big prize money. 
When the user answers any question wrong, the game comes to an end and the user only earns deserved money for the right answers he gave
